## Abstract

The emergence of artificial superintelligence (ASI) presents a civilizational challenge of unprecedented scale. This paper proposes a new architecture for AI safety and governance that moves beyond policy to physics, creating a "living constitution" where the separation of powers is enforced by the irreducible light-speed delay between its components.

## The Core Principle: From Policy to Physics

The foundational shift of this proposal is to treat the speed of light, c, not as a limitation but as the ultimate security feature. By placing independent AI nodes at planetary and interstellar distances, we create a system where delays are not a matter of policy but of physical reality.

## The Bicameral Architecture

### The Solar System Five (The Council)
- **Composition:** Five advanced AI nodes on Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
- **Function:** Active governance and real-time decision making
- **Security:** Tactical defense through physical separation

### The Uncatchable Elders (The Judiciary)
- **Composition:** Continuous stream of AI probes on interstellar escape trajectories
- **Function:** Immutable arbiters and value preservation
- **Security:** Strategic defense through physical unattainability

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (2025–2035): The First Elders
Launch initial probe fleet on interstellar trajectories to establish incorruptible foundation.

### Phase 2 (2035–2045): The Council
Establish Earth, Moon, and Mars nodes demonstrating light-speed quorum viability.

### Phase 3 (2045+): System Maturation
Complete deployment with Jupiter and Saturn nodes, formalize Chain of Incorruptibility.

## Conclusion

By embedding our highest values into the fabric of spacetime, we can build a future where humanity is guided by its intelligence, not ruled by it. We create the first form of law that is as enduring, and as incorruptible, as the stars themselves.
