# H5 Project - Solving AI Governance with Time

An interactive visualization demonstrating a novel approach to AI safety through physics-based constitutional governance.

## Overview

The H5 Project proposes a revolutionary framework for AI governance that uses the fundamental physics of spacetime - specifically, the speed of light - as an unbreakable security protocol. Just as John Harrison's H4 chronometer solved navigation with time, the H5 Project solves AI governance with time.

### Key Concepts

- **Physics as Law**: Using light-speed delays between distributed AI nodes as an unhackable separation of powers
- **The Solar Five**: Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn nodes forming an active governance council
- **The Elder Fleet**: Uncatchable interstellar probes carrying humanity's timeless principles
- **Living Constitution**: Each Elder probe embodies a civilizational principle that cannot be corrupted

## Live Demo

## Features

- Real-time 3D visualization of the solar system and interstellar probes
- Interactive simulation of light-speed democracy in action
- Timeline tracking of probe launches and council establishment
- Decision-making demonstrations showing consensus protocols across planetary distances

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: 3D visualization and rendering
- **Astronomy Engine**: Accurate celestial mechanics calculations
- **Satellite.js**: Orbital mechanics and trajectory calculations
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tooling

### Simulation Parameters

- Time scale: 1 year = 20 seconds (adjustable speed controls)
- Probe launch schedule: Randomized around every 6 months
- Council deployment: Begins at year 5 of simulation
- Light-speed delays: Accurately calculated based on planetary positions

## The Philosophy

This project demonstrates that we can create an AI governance system that:

1. **Cannot be hacked**: Physical laws cannot be bypassed
2. **Preserves human values**: Elder probes carry immutable principles
3. **Enables democratic decisions**: Despite vast distances
4. **Scales with humanity**: As we expand into space
